# Configure Kali
There are a few initial 'tweaks' you'll want to configure in your new Kali instance.

## Kali-tweaks
Open your Kali terminal, and type the following:
`kali-tweaks`

Kali Tweaks  -  allows you to easily configure Kali’s: 
* security hardening
* metapackages
* network repositories
* shell & prompt
* virtualization

Kali comes with Zsh as its default shell, but if you’re anything like me, you’d rather work with Bash. And we can easily change that with this interface.
Use the arrow keys to select `Shell & Prompt`, then press `Enter`.
Select `Default Login Shell` and press `Enter`.
Select `Bash`, and then press `Spacebar` to select it.
Select `Apply` and press `Enter`.

You’ll need to logout, and log back in for these changes to take effect.
Find the Logout icon in the upper right-hand corner that looks like a circle with an arrow inside pointing right.
Select `Log Out`.
Enter your credentials to sign back in.
The changes should have taken effect.
