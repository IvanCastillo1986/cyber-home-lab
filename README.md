# NOTES
While following this guide, youâ€™ll want to change the fake IPv4 IP address `203.0.113.5` to the stated public or private IP for your instance. This is a fake IP address reserved for demonstration purposes.

The commands/output/code provided in this documentation is often preceded by a `$`.<br>
This is meant to mimic a marker for terminal prompt.<br>
When copy/pasting these commands, do not include the `$`.<br>
Including it will probably throw an error.
